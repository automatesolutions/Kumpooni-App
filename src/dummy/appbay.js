Mechanics are experienced and the owner Eugene is a business mechanic who will work with you and will consult on all automotive needs without lying. He is very direct and only deals with specific parts companies that fulfill his quality standard. I've had mechanic shops rip me off before when a simple oil change was needed and a dishonest mechanic would tell me I need this and that fluid replaced, but this place has honest mechanics and honest diagnostics of automobiles. I always leave with confidence that my car had the right quality work performed. Eugene can get cheap parts for your vehicle, but he right away warns me that is not a good option. That's the consulting that i am talking about, he will tell you the truth, but the decision is yours to make. This is my #1 trusted mechanic in all five NYC Burroughs. When you're in this mechanics shop, you get treated with respect and honest opinions. I don't have anxiety anymore when i need to maintain my car with a mechanic because i only go to Sarik Auto shop. By the way, first time getting my timing belt replaced today and when I left the shop I was paying real close attention to my vehicle drive and engine. No joke, I feel like 10 to 20 horsepower was restored back in my car. I have close to 200,000 miles on my Subaru, but after leaving the shop and test driving my car for approximately 2 hours, I would say the car feels like it has only 25000 to 50000 highway driven miles on it. Bravo to Sarik Auto and crew, I am a very content consumer. Thank you.",
